Anomaly based Malware Detection using Machine Learning

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Malware detection and classification is important in providing best security for computer systems. Current detection techniques cannot give the best and accurate in classifying the malware while dealing with new types of  malware. With the rapid increase of malware types, accuracy is important to classify unknown malware.

LITERATURE REVIEW:
https://media.kaspersky.com/en/enterprise-security/Kaspersky-Lab-Whitepaper-Machine-Learning.pdf​

The document on this slide about the use of machine learning for malware detection was our main inspiration for this project, This pdf talks about the efficiency and accuracy of malware detection provided by the use of machine learning such as detecting false positives, detecting new malware with similar hashing, etc. ​

Currently, the majority of antivirus detection ​
system are signature-based, which means that they try to identify malware based on single featured. Cannot detect unknown malware but only identify variants malware that have been previously identified is the disadvantage of signature-based detection system.​

PROPOSED WORK:
We are going to apply Decision Tree Classification technique in our project to detect malwares more efficiently and smartly. The main point of our project is to classify the malicious file, smartly by not only checking its signature as most of the antivirus solutions are doing, but in our project, we are going to look for pattern and according to that we will compare the file and classify them accordingly. 

REAL TIME USAGE:
Our solution will not only classify or identify the malicious program by comparing their hash or signature in the pre-existing data, but we are going to teach our machine to compare the pattern of the PE file with some pre-existing malwares and benign files.​

By doing so, our machine can now identify both pre-existing virus also it can identify new malware.​
